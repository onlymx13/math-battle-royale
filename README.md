# Math: Battle Royale
A battle royale game, written in Node.js. Still in extreme WIP format.

## Running
Use instructions from [https://nodejs.org] to install Node.js on your computer. This is not a tutorial for how to do that because plenty of those exist already.
After installing Node.js, use `./math_battle_royale.sh` to run. This script will run the code locally on your network, and only others on your network will be able to join your room.

## To collaborators
Please test all changes to master extensively before pushing. Automatic deploy to Heroku is enabled. If you don't want to do this, make your changes in another branch. If you break something, I will be sad.
